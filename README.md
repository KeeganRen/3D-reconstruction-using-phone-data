# 3D-reconstruction-using-phone-data
This project deals with performing 3D reconstruction using ICP algorithm and IMU data from phone. Microsoft Kinect is used to scan various objects/scenarios. This is done as part of COMPGV18 - Acquisition and Processing of 3D Geometry in University College London.

This project was done along with my project partner, Xinyang Gao, and this was supervised by Prof. Niloy Mitra.
